# Home_Sales

This project involves using PySpark to analyze home sales data stored in a CSV file. The tasks include reading the data into a DataFrame, creating a temporary table, and answering various SQL queries related to average home prices based on different conditions, such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage. The queries are optimized by caching the data and measuring query runtimes. The data is also partitioned by the "date_built" field, and results are compared for cached and uncached data. The notebook is finalized and uploaded to a GitHub repository for submission.
